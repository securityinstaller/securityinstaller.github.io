On top of that, some consumers came across difficulties with service cancellation, installation of faulty equipment, and extremely aggressive reps.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the clever home tech.

<p>It worked well when we checked the Ring alarm equipment. The door sensing units are a bit large, which can be inconvenient for doors with small or molded frames.
