Not only is the Arlo quick to choose moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out precisely what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years back, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of big names offering expensive, rigid strategies with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term agreements.
