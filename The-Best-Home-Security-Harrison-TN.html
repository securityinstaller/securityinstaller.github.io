Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and in full detail.
