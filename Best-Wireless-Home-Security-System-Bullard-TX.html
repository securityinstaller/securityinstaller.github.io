<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
