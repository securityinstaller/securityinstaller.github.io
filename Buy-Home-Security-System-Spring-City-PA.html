<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential transgressors are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they believe they are being watched or have a higher risk of being captured. This is likewise known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to upset can be lowered by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a culprit being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
