If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't advise that for home security since if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
