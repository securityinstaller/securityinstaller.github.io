<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
