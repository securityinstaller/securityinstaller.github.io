<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
