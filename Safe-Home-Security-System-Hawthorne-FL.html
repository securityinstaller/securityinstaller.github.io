Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a separate source of power, meaning a more complicated setup and more wires. PoE switches are also generally considered as a more secure way to transmit information.</p>
<p>Are you under an existing alarm monitoring contract? Because many agreements have automobile renewal provisions that might lock you in for another 3 to 5 years at high prices, be cautious.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
