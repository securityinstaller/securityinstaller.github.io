Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires.
