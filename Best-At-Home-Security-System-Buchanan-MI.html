<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we loved it as a family pet web cam ). It has given that been improved and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with person detection, a minimum of temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, convenience doesn't always come with added security. If you don't do it right, going from wired to wireless security implies potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks. You don't need to get in a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, alerts Du.

<p>There's no dedicated hub involved here - each camera connects directly to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat service, or a minimum of one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't assist but feel it's also the reason for the Swann's somewhat slow action times.
