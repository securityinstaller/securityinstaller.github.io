<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might equal a few of our top picks. It also features 2 days of totally free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the four mentioned that uses a combination of wired and wireless innovation so keep that in mind.</p>
