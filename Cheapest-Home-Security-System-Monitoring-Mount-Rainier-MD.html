<p>A lot of home security cameras perform the very same basic functions-- they find an event, record the occasion, and send you an alert-- however they don't all perform them the exact same way. And some cameras have special features that exceed those fundamentals.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
