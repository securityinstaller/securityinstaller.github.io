As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
