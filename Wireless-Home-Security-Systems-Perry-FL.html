<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV).
