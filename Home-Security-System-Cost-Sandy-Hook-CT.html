<p>A social agreement about how cameras need to be utilized is important, but in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Modification to the US Constitution uses some protection versus video searches performed by the authorities, there are presently no general, legally enforceable rules to limit privacy invasions and safeguard against abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are required to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government companies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and implemented; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>
