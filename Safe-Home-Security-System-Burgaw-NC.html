<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing recommendation.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
