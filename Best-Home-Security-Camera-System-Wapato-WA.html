<p>Indoor cameras are fantastic for keeping an eye on your kids and pets, but if you're concerned about security, you do not want to run the risk of missing a second of the action.

Despite the fact that it doesn't have the largest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that included a really weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
