<p>We provide value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, comfort and fulfillment to every customer and are devoted to satisfying our client's needs with integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning numerous decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

In this case the alarm company owns the main equipment such as control panel, keypad, motion sensor.

<p>What lots of people do not realize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the public, though not discovered in the big box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Look at the ceiling of customer electronics stores and storage facility chains and you will discover in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason.</p>
