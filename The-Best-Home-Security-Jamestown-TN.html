<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperature levels that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
