<h3>Business Security Alarm System Berryville AR 72616</h3>
<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
