<p>The basic answer is yes. You get strong equipment and trustworthy expert monitoring from both types of security companies when it comes to the fundamentals of home security.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
