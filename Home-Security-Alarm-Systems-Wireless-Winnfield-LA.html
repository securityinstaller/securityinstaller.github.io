<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated smart home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>The type of security camera you pick will depend on the area( s) you're aiming to safeguard.

If you're smartphone smart, we extremely advise looking more into the app of the security system to make sure there is a good user experience and complete control from the app.</p>
