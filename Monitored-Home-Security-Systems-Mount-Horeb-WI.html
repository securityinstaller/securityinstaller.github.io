<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services offering benefit, comfort and satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to satisfying our client's requirements with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and excellent service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
