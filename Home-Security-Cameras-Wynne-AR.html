<p>However monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract.
