<p>We looked for Do It Yourself systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without an agreement. Although some companies supply heavily reduced or free hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some people might want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, in addition to how and when you pay and use for monitoring services.</p>
