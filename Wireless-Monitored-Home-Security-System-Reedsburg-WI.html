As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
