<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will love. It's a cool technique, and one that works quite well, but only once you've configured the rest of the settings. I've got a huge canine, so needed to define the locations for the camera to discover i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the pet dog will be walking. After a few incorrect notifies, and an extremely startled wife, I started to trust the system. Although expect a loud shock if you move it by accident!

You still get 1080p HD streaming, and access to the really instinctive app - simply not as a number of the additional bells and whistles. Some house owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll hinder prospective burglars. These indications might be affixed to a front door, a prominent window, published in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway. The concept of publishing a security alarm indication is that prospective criminals might not want to take a gamble about whether the indication shows the presence of a home security system.</p>
