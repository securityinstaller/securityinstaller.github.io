<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
