<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
