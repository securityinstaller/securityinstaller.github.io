In San Francisco, the Union Square Business Improvement District launched an outdoor security camera program in 2012 with just six independently owned cameras. Now it is a surveillance network of 350 cameras, all of which share video with the police. According to report, grant money spends for around 90% of the cost for the cameras in Union Square, and business owners who wish to take part pay the rest.</p>

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assaulter, given that the interruption of the network avoids the flow of information and really indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transferred. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive assailant to record these codes and use various breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential recorded during the network healing.</p>
